# Pathway

This project was created for my final year at Nottingham Trent University studying BSc Software Engineering. The application has been created in Flutter dart and aims to provide a platform for students and graduates to find their first job or placement scheme.

Abstract -

In the computer science industry, it is becoming increasingly difficult for students and recent graduates to find their first junior role. Research into the matter has shown that only a few top companies such as LinkedIn or Indeed.com, offer a way for the newly educated to find their entry point into any chosen career path. This project aims to determine a new solution for all students and graduates to find their dream first role in any work sector but primarily focusing on developing a successful pitch idea to investors.
The project starts with the creation of a business with the goal of providing students and graduates with the service that they need, in order to find that junior role. The business plan presents the solution to the problem, how the service will be provided with the creation of a minimal viable product and highlights the key analysis required to start the business in the job finding industry. With research into the key competitors of the business, the industries that the business is entering and the customers it provides for. 
Based on the business plan, stems the platform that the business offers its service. The plan determined that the most suitable form of platform to use would be the development of a mobile application. Further research concluded that for a start-up company, a hybrid programming language should be used. For this, the new language produced by Google “Flutter” suited the task perfectly and provided the codebase to build the platform. 
Overall the project successfully produced a business plan for the start-up company “Pathway” along with a minimal viable product as a fully functional Hybrid mobile application in Flutter with a Firebase backend service.
